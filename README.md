# Title: Animated Loading Effect for "Magical Night" Web Page

Overview:
This code snippet implements a brief animated loading effect for a web page themed "Magical Night". The effect involves a 1-second delay before revealing the page's content, enhancing the user's initial experience.

## Key Components:

HTML Structure:
A basic HTML skeleton with a .not-loaded class applied to the <body> element, initially hiding the page content.
Various elements for the "Magical Night" theme (e.g., .night, .flowers, .grow-ans) are assumed to be present within the <body>.
CSS Styling (separate file):
Defines visual styles for the loading state (.not-loaded) and the "Magical Night" theme elements.
Includes animations for an engaging user experience (e.g., .grow-ans, leaf movements).
JavaScript Loading Effect (provided code snippet):
Event Trigger: onload event (or alternatively, DOMContentLoaded event for a more modern approach).
Effect:
Delays for 1 second (1000 milliseconds) using setTimeout.
Removes the .not-loaded class from the <body> element, revealing the page content.
Functionality:

Loading State: Page content is initially hidden due to the .not-loaded class.
Delay and Reveal: After a 1-second delay, the .not-loaded class is removed, making the page content visible and triggering any defined CSS animations.
Customization Points:

Delay Duration: Adjust the 1000 value in setTimeout to change the length of the loading delay.
CSS Animations: Modify or extend the CSS file to alter the visual effects and theme elements.
Event Trigger: Switch between onload and DOMContentLoaded events based on your specific requirements for when the effect should trigger.
